ECS 163 - Final Project

In this assignment, you will apply the data visualization and interaction ideas discussed in lectures, and the skills learned in the previous projects, to a dataset of your choice. You will present your ideas to your peers in a clear and concise manner, and you will demo your project for the instructors. Note that due to the size of the class, you are required to partner with other students to do this project. The team size should be between 3-4. Your final project will take the form of a fully fleshed-out system similar to Project #2, though since this is your second go-around in interactive system design and a team effort, we expect you collectively to do substantially better than what you did in your prior work. See below for a specific list of tasks your interface should accomplish.
